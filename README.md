# hello-world

Hello everyone! Though I am quite new to the realm of programming, I cannot wait to learn more about it and to continue through this new dimension of creativity! I am all about using technologies and tools available in the modern age to create and to just have fun with the kinds of designs and compositions that come to mind, and to delight an audience of my peers! I have always been about animation and creative storytelling. Its a main characteristic of my being, so to be apart of yet another outlet of said storytelling is an exciting, yet sort of scary new pursuit!
